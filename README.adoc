== Concepts list

* Random order vs original order
** vs shuffled?

* JIT selection

* Hashing/indexing through Joiners
** Filters otherwise

* Avoid/shortcut _dead end selections_
** For example:
*** select employee if there are 0 employee instance
*** select other employee if there is 1 employee instance

* Incremental move selection - What does that mean?
** Use of Supply when possible
*** Only update for step scope

* select() vs selectFact() vs selectEntity()
** select uses class to determine if it's selectFact() or selectEntity()
*** selectFact() can cache
*** selectEntity() must listen to step events and adjust accordingly

== Other notes

If A is selected first
and B is selected second
then the selection of C doesn't care how B was selected.
